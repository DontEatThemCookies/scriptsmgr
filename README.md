# David Costell's Scripts Manager
Personal pet project with the goal of expanding my Bash knowledge. Not something with real-world applications or anything like that.
It's exactly what its name describes. Full documentation is in doc.txt

## Install
```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DontEatThemCookies/scriptsmgr/main/scriptsmgr.sh > scriptsmgr.sh
```
If you wish, you may also do the same with doc.txt
