# David Costell's Scripts Manager
Personal pet project with the goal of expanding my Bash knowledge. Not something with real-world applications or anything like that.
It's exactly what its name describes - manages your scripts. Full documentation is in doc.txt

Tested on Raspberry Pi OS (Debian-based)

Analyzed with [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck), tested on bash 5.1.4, tcsh 6.21, zsh 5.8, dash 0.5.11

## Install
```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DontEatThemCookies/scriptsmgr/main/scriptsmgr.sh > scriptsmgr.sh
```
Configure to your liking. If you wish, you may also do the same with doc.txt
